# class-assignments-randomizer
This is a class assignments randomizer which I created while teaching a course at a university. 
We had 48 students each of whom had to write 5 class journals on a random week of the 12-weeks long course. 
This app might be useful for those applying a similar assignments strategy.
Styled with Bootstrap.
